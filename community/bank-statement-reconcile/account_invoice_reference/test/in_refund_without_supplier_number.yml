  In order to check if the reference of the move is the supplier refund number of
  the refund (supplier refunds), I create an refund
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: refund_reference_no_supplier_number, view: account.invoice_supplier_form}:
    account_id: account.a_pay
    check_total: 3000.0
    company_id: base.main_company
    currency_id: base.EUR
    invoice_line:
      - account_id: account.a_expense
        name: '[PCSC234] PC Assemble SC234'
        price_unit: 300.0
        product_id: product.product_product_3
        quantity: 10.0
        uos_id: product.product_uom_unit
    journal_id: account.expenses_journal
    partner_id: base.res_partner_12
    reference_type: none
    type: in_refund
-
  Set again the type of the refund (not set on the first one...)
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: refund_reference_supplier_number, view: account.invoice_supplier_form}:
    type: in_refund
-
  Ensure that the refund is a supplier refund
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: refund_reference_supplier_number}:
    - type == 'in_refund'
-
  I create refund by clicking on Create button
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: refund_reference_no_supplier_number}
-
  I check that the reference of the move is the number of the refund
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: refund_reference_no_supplier_number}:
    - move_id.ref == number
