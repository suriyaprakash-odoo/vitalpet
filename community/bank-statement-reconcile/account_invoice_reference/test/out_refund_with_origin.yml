  In order to check if the reference of the move is the origin of
  the refund (customer refunds), I create a refund
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: refund_reference_origin, view: account.invoice_form}:
    payment_term: account.account_payment_term_advance
    journal_id: account.sales_journal
    partner_id: base.res_partner_3
    reference_type: none
    name: 'Test Customer refund'
    origin: RABC123
    invoice_line:
      - product_id: product.product_product_5
        quantity: 10.0
    type: out_refund
-
  Set again the type of the invoice (not set on the first one...)
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: refund_reference_origin, view: account.invoice_form}:
    type: out_refund
-
  Ensure that the invoice is a customer refund
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: refund_reference_origin}:
    - type == 'out_refund'
-
  I create a refund by clicking on Create button
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: refund_reference_origin}
-
  I check that the reference of the move is the origin of the refund
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: refund_reference_origin}:
    - move_id.ref == 'RABC123'
