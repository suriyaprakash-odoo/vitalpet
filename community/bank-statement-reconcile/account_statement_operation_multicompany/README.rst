Account Statement Operation Multi-company
=========================================

This module fixes Odoo bug nÂ°4706 *account.statement.operation.template is not multi-company aware* https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/4706 that OpenERP S.A. doesn't want to fix because it requires an update of the datamodel in version 8 and this is against their rules for fixes in the stable branch.

Usage
=====

This module adds a read-only *company_id* field on the object *account.statement.operation.template* and a multi-company record rule.

Roadmap
=======

The bug which is solved by this module is supposed to be fixed in version 9, so this module will not be ported to future versions.
