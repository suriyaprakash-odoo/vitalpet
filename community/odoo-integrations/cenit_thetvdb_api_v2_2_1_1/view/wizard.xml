            <field name="name">API v2 targets v1 functionality with a few minor additions. The API is accessible via https://api.thetvdb.com and provides the following REST endpoints in JSON format.


How to use this API documentation
----------------


You may browse the API routes without authentication, but if you wish to send requests to the API and see response data, then you must authenticate.
1. Obtain a JWT token by &#x60;POST&#x60;ing  to the &#x60;/login&#x60; route in the &#x60;Authentication&#x60; section with your API key and credentials.
1. Paste the JWT token from the response into the &quot;JWT Token&quot; field at the top of the page and click the &#x27;Add Token&#x27; button.


You will now be able to use the remaining routes to send requests to the API and get a response.


Language Selection
----------------


Language selection is done via the &#x60;Accept-Language&#x60; header. At the moment, you may only pass one language abbreviation in the header at a time. Valid language abbreviations can be found at the &#x60;/languages&#x60; route..


Authentication
----------------

&#x60;{&quot;apikey&quot;:&quot;APIKEY&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;USERNAME&quot;,&quot;userkey&quot;:&quot;USERKEY&quot;}&#x60;

Note that the username and key are ONLY required for the &#x60;/user&#x60; routes. The user&#x27;s key is labled &#x60;Account Identifier&#x60; in the account section of the main site.
The token is then used in all subsequent requests by providing it in the &#x60;Authorization&#x60; header. The header will look like: &#x60;Authorization: Bearer &lt;yourJWTtoken&gt;&#x60;. Currently, the token expires after 24 hours. You can &#x60;GET&#x60; the &#x60;/refresh_token&#x60; route to extend that expiration date.

----------------
