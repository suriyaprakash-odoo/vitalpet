========================
Partner unique reference
========================

Use the standard reference field on the partner form as a unique partner number.
Adds extra sequence type: 'Partner' and a sequence with code on res.partner.
As default this sequence will be used to assign to partners.
The partner reference will be added to the partner just like the reference for a product in Odoo.
