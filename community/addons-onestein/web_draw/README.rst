==========
Draw Field
==========

This module is very similar to the OCA module web/tree/8.0/web_widget_digitized_signature.
We encourage you to prefer the OCA module!

This module is a basis for other modules; by extending this module you can easily
provide a functionality of recording digital signature images.

By installing this module only, not any functionality will be added to your system.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This module is not working on mobile devices.
One of the future goals will be making this module compatible with mobile devices.
