==============================
Account Activity Based Costing
==============================

By installing this module, on analytic accounts will be displayed a new set of
information that could help a manager to better analyze his projects.

In particular, it's possible to set for each analytic account how many working
hours are expected as well as expected turnover and costs. Then the system
will automatically compute how many hours were used as well as realized
turnover and costs, based on timesheet lines related to the analytic account
itself.

Configuration
=============

No special configuration is needed beyond what is already required to work with
analytic accounts.


Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to 'Invoicing' - 'Configuration' - 'Analytic Accounting' - 'Analytic Accounts'
#. Select or Create an Analytic Account
#. In the 'Accounting Budget' group you can set Expected Hours, Costs and Turnover
#. The information about Worked Hours and Realized Costs and Turnovers are automatically updated according to the timesheet lines
